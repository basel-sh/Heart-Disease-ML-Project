# 🫀 Heart Disease ML Project

This is a complete machine learning pipeline I built for predicting heart disease using clinical data. It’s part of my AI/ML summer course project, and I used it to apply everything I’ve learned — from preprocessing to model export and even optional deployment.

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Clean and prepare the dataset
- Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Perform feature selection to find the most important variables
- Train and evaluate different supervised learning models
- Use unsupervised learning for clustering insights
- Tune hyperparameters for better accuracy
- Export the best model for deployment
- _(Bonus)_ Build a simple web app using Streamlit

## 📌 Notes

This project helped me understand the complete ML process. I got to work on data cleaning, model training, evaluation, and even exporting a trained model. It was a great experience to connect everything together in one clean pipeline.
